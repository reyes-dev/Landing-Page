# Landing-Page
This is my attempt at the Landing Page Project of the Odin Project.
It has 4 main sections and a footer.
I'll mainly be demonstrating my ability to use CSS flexbox.
I'll also be practicing my basic CSS/HTML skills.
For example, setting up the boilerplate and structuring the content in HTML.
As well as giving that content color, size, and interactivity in CSS. 
Finally, I'll be commiting with Git each step of the way, and pushing to the main repo on Github!
